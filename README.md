# ðŸ§  Brainalyze: Harmful Brain Activity Classification

**Brainalyze** is a deep learning research project focused on classifying harmful brain activity from EEG signals using advanced ensemble models. The project explores various spectrogram-based preprocessing techniques, transfer learning models, and post-processing methods to reduce the KL divergence and improve classification performance.
